![NyaoVim](resources/title-bar.png)
===================================

This is a [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) frontend built on [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/).  The Neovim editor is [composed as a Web Component](https://github.com/rhysd/neovim-component) and users can extend the UI with reusable Web Components, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

**This repository is being heavily developed.  Everything is unstable.**

`:help design-not` says:

> Use Vim as a component from a shell or in an IDE.

NyaoVim is built in the same spirit.  NyaoVim contains the Neovim editor as a Web Component and extends its UI with web technology, as in other modern editors and IDEs (e.g. [Atom](http://atom.io/), [VS Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [LightTable](http://lighttable.com/)).

## Goals

- **NyaoVim bundles no extended UI by default.**  It only provides the nice UI plugin architecture.  Users can compose their favorite UI with Web Components, HTML and CSS.  It is also easy to make a NyaoVim distribution where useful components are bundled.
- **Do not introduce another plugin manager.**  HTML for Web Components should be bundled with Vim plugins.  Therefore, a Vim plugin manager can handle UI components, letting us bundle JS and Vim script code.
- **Do not lose Vim's comfortability by default.**  It should be aware of performance.
- **UI component creators can use powerful APIs, packages and tools**; [Node.js APIs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), [Electron APIs](https://github.com/atom/electron/tree/master/docs/api), [Neovim msgpack-rpc APIs](https://neovim.io/doc/user/msgpack_rpc.html)), so many [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/).
- **Cross Platform** (Linux, OS X, Windows)

Memo: 'nyao' is 'meow' in Japanese and its pronounce resembles 'neo'.  It is also an acronym for 'Not Yet Another Original'.

## App Structure

NyaoVim consists of Web Components on Electron as seen in the following figure.  At first there is only `<neovim-editor>` and you can add/remove additional components.

## UI Plugin Examples

UI plugins are installable as easily as regular plugins.  Each of them is written within 100~300 lines.  You can also create reusable Web Components and integrate them into NyaoVim.

## Usage

### Getting Started

You can install NyaoVim as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyaovim).  Currently no packaging release is available yet.  If you use Windows and haven't installed Neovim yet, please read [first tips](docs/tips.md) first.

```sh
$ npm install -g nyaovim
```

`npm` may require `sudo` if you installed `node` pacakge via system package manager.

If you haven't installed Neovim yet, please install it following [Neovim's instructions](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim) because NyaoVim internally uses the `nvim` command.  **Note that `nvim` v0.1.6 or later is needed.**

You can start NyaoVim with the `nyaovim` command if you install this app with npm.

```sh
$ nyaovim [files...]
```

You would see a minimal Neovim GUI editor (like gVim).  This is an Electron app and Neovim is drawn on `<canvas>`.  You can see the DevTools of this app with the 'Developer Tools' menu item.

On first start up of NyaoVim, it creates `~/.config/nyaovim/nyaovimrc.html` for UI configuration (`%AppData%` instead of `.config` in Windows; it may differ from Neovim, run `set AppData` from command line to get the path).  Yes, you can extend and configure UI components with HTML and CSS!

### Configure Editor Options

I guess you're now thinking 'Hmm, font is not good and too small...'. You can configure some editor options by properties of [`<neovim-editor>` properties](https://github.com/rhysd/neovim-component#neovim-editor-properties).
For example, below configures font face and font size by `font` and `font-size` properties.  Then set line-height to 1.5 (for example, Atom adopts 1.5 as line-height).

```html
<neovim-editor
    id="nyaovim-editor"
    argv="[[argv]]"
    font-size="14"
    font="Ricty,monospace"
    line-height="1.5"
></neovim-editor>
```

And you can also configure browser window options with `browser-config.json` (e.g. Preserving window state, Single instance app, and so on). See [tips](docs/tips.md) for more detail.

### Install UI Plugin

For example, let's install [nyaovim-popup-tooltip](https://github.com/rhysd/nyaovim-popup-tooltip).

As described in the Goals section, a UI plugin is a normal Neovim plugin.  You can install it like any other Neovim plugin.  If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), all you need is adding below line to your `init.vim`.

```vim
Plug 'rhysd/nyaovim-popup-tooltip'
```

Then you need to put the popup tooltip UI on your NyaoVim interface.  Please open `~/.config/nyaovim/nyaovimrc.html` (`%AppData%` instead of `.config` in Windows; it may differ from Neovim, run `set AppData` from command line to get the path).  As described in the Goals section, a user can build a UI with HTML and CSS with high customization.

Please add `<popup-tooltip>` tag under `<neovim-editor>` tag as below

```html
<neovim-editor id="nyaovim-editor" argv="[[argv]]"></neovim-editor>
<popup-tooltip editor="[[editor]]"></popup-tooltip>
```

`<popup-tooltip>` is a [Polymer](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer) component.  `editor="[[editor]]"` is a data binding to pass editor instance to `<popup-tooltip>`.

After installing nyaovim-popup-tooltip as a Neovim plugin and adding UI to HTML, you're all done!  Open NyaoVim, move the cursor to any image path, and enter `gi`.  NyaoVim will load the image and show it in a popup tooltip as below.
